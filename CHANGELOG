CHANGELOG
=========

sjs 2009-11-21
v 0.9.3 (one more bug fix for today)

      - Don't pass -d switch to commands that don't accept it.

sjs 2009-11-21
v 0.9.2 (bug fixes)

      - reading json files no longer messes up your buffer history.

      - app list completion works now (caching bug)

sjs 2009-11-21
v 0.9.1

      - Added mojo-package-install-and-launch.

      - New variable for specifying whether commands target the
        device or emulator, *mojo-target*.  Set it to 'usb' for a
        real device and 'tcp' for the emulator.  Defaults to 'tcp'.
        To set the default target you can use the convenience
        functions mojo-target-device and mojo-target-emulator.

sjs 2009-11-20
v 0.9

      - Automatically find Mojo project root by searching upwards
        for appinfo.json.

      - Added command for generating new scenes,
        mojo-generate-scene.

      - mojo-package now operates only on the current project.

      - Parse appinfo.json to get version, used for installing &
        launching with less interaction.

      - mojo-install, mojo-launch, mojo-inspect, and mojo-delete
        still read in arguments but have the current project/app as
        the default values.

      - New convenience method: mojo-package-install-and-inspect
        This function only operates on the active app and does not
        read in any input.

      - Remembered filenames and app ids are cleared when the Mojo
        project root changes. (DWIM)

      - Parse output of `palm-install --list` for app id
        completion.  App id completion was ported from cheat.el.

v 0.2 - Fixed some minor bugs
v 0.1 - Initial release
