CHANGELOG
=========

sjs 2009-12-07
v 0.9.10 (bug fix)

      - All arguments sent through mojo-cmd now quoted before being
        sent to the shell (in case filenames contain spaces).  Values
        are unintelligently wrapped in double quotes, this is *not*
        escaping, just brain-dead quoting.

      - New default key binding: C-c C-c C-d runs mojo-target-device

sjs 2009-12-04
v 0.9.9 (bug fix)

      - Fixed the value of *mojo-switch-suffixes*, which was confusing
        mojo-switch-file-dwim.

sjs 2009-12-04
v 0.9.8 (framework_config.json support)

      - Implemented support for framework_config.json.  Functions for
        both reading and writing all known values.

sjs 2009-12-03
v 0.9.7 (hooks)

      - Added mojo-setup-mode-hooks which adds
        mojo-maybe-enable-minor-mode to the specified mode hooks.
        When the hooked modes are activated on files under a Mojo
        project root also activate mojo-mode.

sjs 2009-12-01
v 0.9.6 (minor mode)

      - Created mojo-mode, a minor mode with keybindings.

      - Prefixed *all* functions with "mojo-".

sjs 2009-11-24
v 0.9.5 (bug fix)

      - Now that I have a real Palm Pre device I was able to test
        device support.  Turns out I couldn't (easily) target the
        device because mojo-target-device was not interactive.
        Whoops.

sjs 2009-11-22
v 0.9.4 launch emulator if needed

      - Commands that use the emulator launch it if necessary and wait
        till it is fully booted before running commands.

sjs 2009-11-21
v 0.9.3 (one more bug fix for today)

      - Don't pass -d switch to commands that don't accept it.

sjs 2009-11-21
v 0.9.2 (bug fixes)

      - reading json files no longer messes up your buffer history.

      - app list completion works now (caching bug)

sjs 2009-11-21
v 0.9.1

      - Added mojo-package-install-and-launch.

      - New variable for specifying whether commands target the device
        or emulator, *mojo-target*.  Set it to 'usb' for a real device
        and 'tcp' for the emulator.  Defaults to 'tcp'.  To set the
        default target you can use the convenience functions
        mojo-target-device and mojo-target-emulator.

sjs 2009-11-20
v 0.9

      - Automatically find Mojo project root by searching upwards for
        appinfo.json.

      - Added command for generating new scenes, mojo-generate-scene.

      - mojo-package now operates only on the current project.

      - Parse appinfo.json to get version, used for installing &
        launching with less interaction.

      - mojo-install, mojo-launch, mojo-inspect, and mojo-delete still
        read in arguments but have the current project/app as the
        default values.

      - New convenience method: mojo-package-install-and-inspect

        This function only operates on the active app and does not
        read in any input.

      - Remembered filenames and app ids are cleared when the Mojo
        project root changes. (DWIM)

      - Parse output of `palm-install --list` for app id completion.
        App id completion was ported from cheat.el.

v 0.2 - Fixed some minor bugs
v 0.1 - Initial release
