Overview
========

Mojo.el is an Emacs package that provides interactive functions to aid
the development of webOS apps.  There is a minor mode that can be
toggled with the command `mojo-mode', or enabled automatically by
setting up mode hooks in your emacs config.  There's a convenience
function called mojo-setup-mode-hooks that takes one or more hook
variable names and adds mojo-maybe-enable-minor-mode to each hook.
mojo-maybe-enable-minor-mode enables mojo-mode for files under a Mojo
project root.

Latest version is available on github:
    http://github.com/samsonjs/mojo.el
    
And usually also on Emacs Wiki:
